<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a passionate beginner developer, excited to dive into the world of programming and software development. I've recently embarked on my coding journey and am eager to learn new technologies, solve problems, and bring ideas to life through code. Currently, I'm building my skills in JavaScript, HTML/CSS etc. And focusing on understanding the fundamentals of web development, algorithms, and data structures.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. My goal is to continue learning, experimenting, and building projects that can help me improve my skills and contribute to the tech community. I’m particularly interested in web development and I’m excited about what the future holds as I work toward becoming a proficient developer.</p>
